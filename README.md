ARCHIE: Augmented Reality for Cultural Heritage Interpretation and Education
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This part of an MSc Project to build an augmented reality application to encourage walking tours on the Antonine Wall in Central Scotland.

As a stepping stone to getting a testable application running on mobile devices, this part of the project involves the creation of a web service to provide ARML data to Wikitude (http://www.wikitude.com). The service allows points of interest to be shown in the Wikitude World Browser, with custom icons and media attachments.

The service is built using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), and runs on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com).

A Jekyll blog covering the whole project is available at https://rdallasgray.github.com/archie-blog.

Contact me via GitHub if you're interested in the project.
